      "text": "The small pieces of ore indicate that there is a vein of that ore nearby underground, so it is important to take note of its location for when you later have a pickaxe and are ready to mine.$(br)Tip: Once a piece of ore or rock has been picked up from the ground, it cannot be placed back down, so only gather what you need to save on inventory space. A single stack of up to 64 rocks will be more than sufficient for your first few in-game days."
