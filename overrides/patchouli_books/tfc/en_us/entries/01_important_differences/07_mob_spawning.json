Areas with this hostile mob spawn protection will not spawn hostile mobs regardless of the current light level. With the removal of the light-level dependency for mob spawning, TerraFirmaCraft has also implemented the ability for torches to burn out."

These animals do not despawn and will not respawn after they have been killed. Wild animals such as bears, pheasants, deer, squid, fish and untamed wolves can despawn and have the possibility to respawn using the vanilla friendly mob respawn mechanic."
